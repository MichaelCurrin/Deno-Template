# ðŸ¦• Deno-Template

This is a very simple Deno Template.

## Requirements

To run the Deno Template, the following will need to be installed and available from your shell:

- [Deno](https://deno.land/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting started

This template uses `make` to run the Deno commands.

- `make run`: runs the `src/server.ts`
- `make test`: runs the tests
- `make debug`: runs the debugger starting in the `src/server.ts`
- `make build`: Builds your project into a single file in `dist/server`
- `make clean`: Deletes the `dist` directory

## Status

- [x] Config for enviroment variables.
- [x] Logger to log the pretty messages.
- [ ] Extend the project to include more resources.
- [ ] Think about a better structure.
- [ ] And honestly probably more...
